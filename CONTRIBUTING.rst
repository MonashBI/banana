Banana is proposed to be a collaborative project with contributions from a wide
range of authors welcome. If you make a contribution please add your name to
the list of authors in the banana/__about__.py script.

If you add new analysis methods to Banana that you think would be of wider
interest please submit a pull request with your additions. Please also provide
a unittest using the unittesting framework in the *banana.utils.testing* module
when submitting your request.

Note that project-specific analyses can be implemented in sub-classes of core
Banana "Analysis" classes, so it is not always necessary to make changes in Banana
itself.
