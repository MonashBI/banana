Banana is proposed to be a collaborative project with contributions from a wide range of authors welcome.

If you add new analysis methods to Banana that you think would be of wider interest please submit a pull request with
your additions. Please also provide a unittest, using the unittesting framework in the _banana.utils.testing_ module
when submitting your request.

Note that project-specific analyses can be implemented in sub-classes of core Banana "Study" classes, so it is not always
necessary to make changes in Banana itself.
